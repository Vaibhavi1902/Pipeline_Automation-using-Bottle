* Nextflow dependencies installation
sudo snap install curl 
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
sudo mv /home/bioinformatics/Documents/nextflow /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/nextflow

sudo → run as superuser (admin), since you're modifying a system folder.
    • chmod → stands for change mode, which changes permissions on a file.
    • +x → adds execute permission to the file.
    • /usr/local/bin/nextflow → that’s the path to the Nextflow executable you just moved.
 nextflow -v
Option 2: Move it to ~/.local/bin/ (just for your user)
#user-only:
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv /home/bioinformatics/Documents/nextflow ~/.local/bin/
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/nextflow
ls -l /usr/local/bin/nextflow
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
which nextflow
nextflow run nextflow.nf
which fastqc
find / -name "fastqc" 2>/dev/null
find / -name "bwa" 2>/dev/null
export PATH=$PATH:/home/bioinformatics/Linux_tutorial/FastQC/fastqc
source ~/.bashrc
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/bwa
 source ~/.bashrc
cd /home/bioinformatics/Documents
nextflow run cancer_nextflow.nf
